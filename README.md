# game-of-life

- Conway's game of life project for Lambda School
- Will use react to bootstrap my application 
- Class Components to handle state
- Functional Components for components that don't need state management

## Structure

- All the app is rendered in App.js
- Main.js contains all the game logic and button functionality
- Grid.js takes care of the actual display of the grid and the variable grid size
- Box.js contains individual box or square state, such as dead or true, and neighbor awareness
- Buttons.js handles the display and visualization of the buttons
- Rules.js is a functional component that only explains game rules and controls
- Info.js explains what cellular automata are and describes how they are useful in real life, also explains the 'Turing Completeness' of the game.
- Also explains how the  game uses 'double buffering' to implement the game and why it is useful in this situation
- Footer.js contains a small footer for the app to make it look more complete and professional








Student should be able to explain what cellular automata are and describe how they are useful in real life:

Student should be able to correctly analyze the ‘Turing Completeness’ of Conway’s “Game of Life”:

Student should be able to utilize "double buffering" to implement the game

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.
